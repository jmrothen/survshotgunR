Developer Notes

Use these things for package development

devtools: check, build, document, load_all
    Maybes: reload, test (relies on testthat)

Rcpp: compileAttributes    (basically imports the cpp functions)
  -> PLEASE REMEMBER THIS


usethis: use_data, use_data_raw



If the push/pull buttons break, send a push with -u at the end.
