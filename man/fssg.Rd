\usage{
fssg(
  formula,
  data = NA,
  models = NA,
  skip = c("default"),
  opt_method = "BFGS",
  spline = NA,
  max_knots = 1,
  dump_models = TRUE,
  detailed = TRUE,
  ibs = FALSE,
  progress = TRUE,
  warn = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula. Should be a survival formula, with a Surv object on the left hand side.}

\item{data}{If your formula needs a dataset, provide that here.}

\item{models}{Vector of strings. If you only want to run specific models, specify them here by their list name in fssg_dist_list.}

\item{skip}{Vector. If you want to skip any specific models, you can add their names here. By default, some of the repetitive or incredibly niche models are skipped.}

\item{opt_method}{String. By default, 'BFGS' is used in flexsurvreg, however some distributions appreciate the more flexible 'Nelder-Mead' method. This is passed to the "optim" function as method = opt_method.}

\item{spline}{Vector. Should include 'rp' for Royston-Parmar natural cubic spline. Can also include 'wy' for Wang-Yan alternative natural cubic spline. The Wang-Yan version requires the package 'splines2ns'. If set to NA, then the spline step will be skipped.}

\item{max_knots}{Integer. Specifies the maximum number of knots considered in spline models.}

\item{dump_models}{Logical. If TRUE, each successful model will be placed into a list and returned by the function invisibly.}

\item{detailed}{Logical. If True, calculates a number of additional fit statistics for each model.}

\item{ibs}{Logical. If TRUE, calculate integrated brier score for each model. Please note that this greatly increases run time, and is not recommended for extremely large data.}

\item{progress}{Logical. Want progress updates?}

\item{warn}{Logical. If TRUE, also prints any warnings that appear.}
}
\value{
List containing a summary of the models generated. If dump_models is True, also returns a list of generated models.
