\title{Collect fit statistics for a parametric survival model}
\usage{
get_fit_stats(Surv_object, model, ibs = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Surv_object}{Survival Object of form \code{survival::Surv}. Should be from the left side of the survival model function.}

\item{model}{Model object. Currently formatted to work with flexsurvreg objects, and may work for other types of models.}

\item{ibs}{Logical. If True, calculates the integrated Brier Score, which is a helpful fit statistic but is considerably slower to calculate than all other statistics.}
}
\value{
List of fit statistics for the model.
}
\description{

\examples{
require(survival)
require(flexsurv)
flexsurvreg(Surv(time,status) ~age +sex, data=cancer, dist= 'weibull') -> model
get_fit_stats(Surv(cancer$time, cancer$status), model = model, ibs = FALSE)
