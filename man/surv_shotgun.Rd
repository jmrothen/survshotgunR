\usage{
surv_shotgun(
  formula,
  data = NA,
  skip = c("default"),
  dump_models = F,
  progress = T,
  warn = F,
  spline = c("rp"),
  max_knots = 2,
  coxph = F,

  ibs = F
)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula. Should be a survival formula, with a Surv object on the left hand side.}

\item{data}{If your formula needs a dataset, provide that here.}

\item{skip}{Vector. If you want to skip any specific models, you can add their names here. By default, some of the repetitive or incredibly niche models are skipped.}

\item{dump_models}{Logical. If TRUE, each successful model created will be loaded into memory as fssg_<model_name>}

\item{progress}{Logical. Want progress updates?}

\item{warn}{Logical. If TRUE, also prints any warnings that appear.}

\item{spline}{Vector. Should include 'rp' for Royston-Parmar natural cubic spline. Can also include 'wy' for Wang-Yan alternative natural cubic spline. The Wang-Yan version requires the package 'splines2ns'.}

\item{max_knots}{Integer. Specifies the maximum number of knots considered in spline models.}

\item{coxph}{Logical. If TRUE, calculates a Cox Proportional Hazard Model as well. Please note that is not recommended to directly compare the AIC/BIC/LogLik of Cox models to Parametric models}

\item{detailed}{Logical. If True, calculates a number of additional fit statistics for each model.}

\item{ibs}{Logical. If TRUE, calculate integrated brier score for each model. Please note that this greatly increases run time, and is not recommended for extremely large data.}
}
\value{
Data frame summarizing each model, and some general goodness of fit measures.
